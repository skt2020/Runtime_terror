# Version -1.6 (Beta)

# BETA version notice
This is an early preview and is neither perfect nor fully featured. This is a glimpse of our direction but may change quite a bit without notice.

You can use it to manage your appointments and more features will be added until we feel ready to have it take over the existing interface.

IMPORTANT: this is the admin side and NOT what your clients will see and use, which isn't changing yet.



# Runtime_terror
This Project aims its objectives to multiple foregrounds namely Fun, Entertainment and Education through one app digitally. The application is to provide a gaming environment to the user whilst checking his/her knowledge also. The knowledge will be tested as the application asks you several question about what you want the application to predict, so in this way the information of user is also tested and increasing through the application. The Main task of the application is to predict that what the user is thinking about and this is done by asking related questions which are logically made to converge to the right guess hopefully!! Interface and voice input commands and voice interaction from the user interface of the game is also attractive and engrossing. The future objective is to train the voice feedback of the game to give an informative output in form of voice so that this application can be used for fun and education purpose.
